It may be good to first build specific apps, like password vaults, which are used by just one person and not shared, to make key management easier.

Note if you leave an encrypted file in your pod, an easy attack  is to brute force attack by trying all the combinations, if your key is short like a PIN.  So keys have to be big.

This is just like leaving app-encrypted file in your pod, like encrypted PDFs.""";

Achieve this by combining Solid, a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralised data stores, and m-ld, a technology for real-time information sharing.

These technologies share a common data representation, making the combination natural and harmonious. Solid will provide for Identity, Authentication, Authorisation and server storage of resources, while m-ld will provide real-time synchronisation of resource replicas, including locally on devices.

Benefits to users of apps built with this innovation would include the ability to collaborate on documents in real-time, the ability to work offline, and greater performance and resilience of the app, so that they are always able to continue acting on information.
